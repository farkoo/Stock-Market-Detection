# Stock-Market-Detection

In this repository, we want to predict the stock value of Google using recurrent neural network.


We have designed our recurrent network using the settings and checked its effect on the ability to predict the stock value of this company.
The items that have been reviewed are:
* Using GRU and LSTM blocks
* Using various optimization functions such as Adam and RMSprop
* Using various cost functions such as MSE and MAPE
* The effect of using dropout
